# Quality-Start-Classifier
Predicting the likelihood that an MLB pitcher will earn a 'quality start' (QS) next game

# Project Description

In Major League Baseball (MLB), each team has a pitching rotation they cycle through each week. Pitchers cannot play daily because doing so, adds wear and tear to their throwing arm, so these starts are typically once a week. Of the statistics that help determine a pitcher’s success in a particular start, the QS may be the most important. This is because a pitcher has two essential jobs: to prevent runs and force enough outs to get his teams’ batters back in a position to score. To get a QS, a pitcher must allow three or less earned runs and play at least six innings. The QS is a particularly important metric in fantasy baseball because of its correlation to other pitching categories we are trying to win: ERA, WHIP, and strikeouts.
